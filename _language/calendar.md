I received a tear-off Japanese calendar as a gift. Aside from many horological divisions and symbols, each day has a short saying at the bottom. I've started translating these, in an effort to improve my vocabulary.

## ２０２０年１月２０日（月）
無病は　一生の　極楽  
mubyou wa　isshou no　gokuraku  
Good health is a life in Paradise.  

## ２０２０年１月１６日（金）
山椒は 小粒 でも ぴりりと 辛い  
sanshou wa kutsubu demo piriri to karai  
Japanese pepper may be small, but it packs a punch.


*極楽 is the name of a Buddhist realm, [Sukhavati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhavati).*
