## Troubleshooting
### Can't stop engine
Unlike a petrol engine, a diesel engine does not require electrical ignition for combustion. The compressed air in a diesel engine reaches a temperature high enough to ignite the fuel.

This means that once it's running, it's pretty easy to keep the engine running - it only needs fuel and air.

Removing the fuel line from the intake pump will *eventually* cause the engine to stop, after it's exhausted the fuel left in the pump and lines.

Removing the air supply could be used if the engine is getting fuel from somewhere else (e.g. leaking oil).

*Possible causes: faulty key switch, faulty fuel stop solenoid.*

## Component details
### Key switch
The key has 5 positions:
+ **a** Off position (insert and remove key)
+ **b** Warning and instrument lamps only (use once started)
+ **c** Thermostart (pre-heats air intake... about 15-30 seconds?)
+ **d** Start
+ **e** Engine stop

The starter should not be used for more than 10 secs, without a rest of at least 30 seconds.

The switch should not be left in the stop position (**e**) because the stop solenoid draws a lot of current and will be damaged. The Bukh manual states that the alarm functions are tested in position position e, not sure what that means... the alarm sounds in position e and... b or c?

The thermostart heats an electric coil in the air inlet manifold which then ignites fuel, so that the air intake is preheated.
