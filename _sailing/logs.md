2019-12-14   First sailing in our yacht. Sandringham to Docklands. Arrived in the middle of a speech by Lisa Blair. Met Dan, won a trip on Lisa's yacht next week, went for dinner: us three, Lisa and Tom (Corsair, Southport).
2019-12-16   Visited yacht around 7pm to fit new mooring lines. Met Lisa and Mark who are in opposite berth.
2019-12-21   Dan, Sarah and I went sailing on Lisa's yacht. Winds were 25+ kts, she decided it was too rough to take us out into the bay. We sailed up and back the port entry a few times.

2019-12-14   IDEA/TODO           
2019-12-16   APPL.               Switched worn lines that came with boat for new mooring lines: 16mm by 10m.
             NOTE                10m line is too short for spring lines.
                                 Test: lifted rear port shackle using shock cord to reduce rattle.
                                 Test: tied shock cord b/w mainsheet and toerail to stop sliding in wind.
             IDEA/TODO           Cut wooden block to fit between traveller pieces and stop sliding.
                                 Sprayed lubricant on squealing companionway hatch. Did not fix - interior.
             IDEA/TODO           Remove companionway roof and lubricate interior.
                                 Improve bilge drainage!
                                 Replace prop anode.
