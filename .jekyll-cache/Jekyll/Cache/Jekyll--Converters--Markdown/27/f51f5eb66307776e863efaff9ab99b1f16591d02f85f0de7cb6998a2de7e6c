<p>Unlike a petrol engine, a diesel engine does not require electrical ignition for combustion. The compressed air in a diesel engine reaches a temperature high enough to ignite the fuel.</p>

<p>This means that once it’s running, it’s pretty easy to keep the engine running - it only needs fuel and air.</p>

<p>Removing the fuel line from the intake pump will <em>eventually</em> cause the engine to stop, after it’s exhausted the fuel left in the pump and lines.</p>
