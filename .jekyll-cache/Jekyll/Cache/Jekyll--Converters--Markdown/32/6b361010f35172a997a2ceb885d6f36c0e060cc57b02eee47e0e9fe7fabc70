I"×<p>I use a plain hardcover notebook to keep track of appointments, to do lists and as a general log. Because itâ€™s a plain notebook, I add new sections/pages as I go and donâ€™t have to worry about running out of room.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how I structure it:</p>

<h1 id="year-to-dogoals">Year to do/goals</h1>

<h1 id="year-events">Year events</h1>
<h1 id="monthly-to-dogoals">Monthly to do/goals</h1>
<h1 id="monthly-events">Monthly events</h1>
<h1 id="daily">Daily</h1>
