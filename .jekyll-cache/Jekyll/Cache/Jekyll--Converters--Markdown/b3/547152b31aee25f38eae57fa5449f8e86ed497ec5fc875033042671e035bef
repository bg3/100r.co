I"œ<p>I use a plain hardcover notebook to keep track of appointments, to do lists and as a general log. Because itâ€™s a plain notebook, I add new sections/pages as I go and donâ€™t have to worry about running out of room.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how I structure it:</p>

<h2 id="year-to-dogoals">Year to do/goals</h2>
<p>I add this page when I start the notebook. This is where I capture any goals or tasks that I wonâ€™t be doing in the current month. This is a good place for loosely defined goals as well.</p>

<p>When I start a new month, I choose which of these Iâ€™d like to attempt in that month and write them down in that monthâ€™s <strong>month to do/goals</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="year-events">Year events</h2>
<p>Similar to the <strong>year to do/goals</strong>, this is for regular occurrences like birthdays and events/appointments that are in the future. I just write a date and a description when I add them and donâ€™t worry that theyâ€™re not necessarily in chronological order.</p>

<p>When I start a new month, I look for any events listed for that month and write them in that monthâ€™s <strong>month events</strong> page.</p>

<h2 id="month-to-dogoals">Month to do/goals</h2>
<h2 id="month-events">Month events</h2>
<p>I write these pages at the start of the month. For the month events I write the days of the month down one page, one day per line and write any appointments on the line.</p>

<p>They both work similarly to the year pages, at the start of a week I copy over any goals I want to achieve or events that will occur to their pages.</p>

<p>I find I put more items into the month pages than the year pages because I donâ€™t get a lot of advance notice on things.</p>

<h2 id="daily">Daily</h2>
<p>I combine the goals and events into a single daily page. Each day can be less than a whole page, depending on how much you note down.</p>

<p>I set up the daily pages at the start of each week, filling out the scheduled appointments from the monthly list and picking the tasks I want to achieve from the monthly goals. You could make a weekly goals section but I think once you get to this level itâ€™s better to allocate them to a specific day.</p>
