I"(<p>I use a plain hardcover notebook to keep track of appointments, to do lists and as a general log. Because it’s a plain notebook, I add new sections/pages as I go and don’t have to worry about running out of room.</p>

<p>Here’s how I structure it:</p>

<h2 id="year-to-dogoals">Year to do/goals</h2>
<p>I add this page when I start the notebook. This is where I capture any goals or tasks that I won’t be doing in the current month. This is a good place for loosely defined goals as well.</p>

<p>When I start a new month, I choose which of these I’d like to attempt in that month and write them down in the monthly to do/goals.</p>

<h2 id="year-events">Year events</h2>
<h2 id="monthly-to-dogoals">Monthly to do/goals</h2>
<h2 id="monthly-events">Monthly events</h2>
<h2 id="daily">Daily</h2>
