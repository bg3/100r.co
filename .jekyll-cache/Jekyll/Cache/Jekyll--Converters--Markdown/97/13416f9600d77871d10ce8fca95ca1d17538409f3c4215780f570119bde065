<h2 id="length">Length</h2>
<p>Bow and stern lines ~ 2/3 of boat length: 21-22 ft.
Spring lines ~ same length as boat: 32 ft.</p>

<p>Ropeinc site above suggests that 12-strand is not as strong as double braid, and that coloured line is not as strong as white. Nylon is good because it has stretch.</p>

<p>** 2019-12-16: bought 4 x 16mm, 10m lines. Should have got two of them half as long again, because our boat doesnâ€™t have midship cleatsâ€¦ so the springers have to lead back to the fore and aft.**</p>

<p>from <a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/boating-knots">https://www.animatedknots.com/boating-knots</a></p>

<p>Breast Lines prevent rotation and should run roughly at 90o to the dock. To gain length, they should be led from the farthest part of the boat: the bow itself (or the outer hull of a catamaran) and from the far quarter of the stern.</p>

<p>Spring Lines prevent fore and aft movement and should run nearly parallel to the dock and may cross each other to obtain an optimal lie.</p>

<p>Double all lines with high winds (50 kt +)</p>

<p>The â€˜cleatâ€™ on the foredeck is actually called a Samson post, although perhaps not a true one?
Seems like midship cleats would be worth it.
