I"j<p>I use a plain hardcover notebook to keep track of appointments, to do lists and as a general log. Because it’s a plain notebook, I add new sections/pages as I go and don’t have to worry about running out of room.</p>

<p>Here’s how I structure it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>list-style</li>
  <li>list to
    <ul>
      <li>list again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
