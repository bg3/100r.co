I"A<p>I use a plain hardcover notebook to keep track of appointments, to do lists and as a general log. Because it’s a plain notebook, I add new sections/pages as I go and don’t have to worry about running out of room.</p>

<p>Here’s how I structure it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2
 – item 3</li>
</ul>
