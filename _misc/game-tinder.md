## space
Gone Home x an escape room from the perspective of an AI on a spaceship. Gradually gain access to explore more areas of the ship. Perhaps the AI is a crime scene investigator, sent via radio to the non-responsive ship.

Wood/black/gold/camel/cream/red ship, with purple/green/pink UI/AI stuff.

What kind of ship? Hotel/cruise ship... cargo ship... a space station?

## delivery

2D physics. float around with a little grappling hook descending from your odd flying/floating contraption.
abstract? or actually delivering objects from and to places?
