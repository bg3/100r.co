I want to track a few aspects of my life:
- projects I work on, how focused or procrastinated I was
- other activities, such as spending time with others
- my wellbeing, mood, meditation
- whether i thought of others
- leisure

For my projects and work: I care about what it was, how focused I was. Do I care about how satisfied I was, or how long it was?
I don't want to be working on more than one project at a time.
For meditation, I care about how long I did it.
For other activities, I just care whether I did it - watched a movie, played games. If a movie takes up half a day and I work on the rest, how do I show that I used half the available time for projects?
Wellbeing, a lot of these can be binary - happy/not, exercise/not, thinking about others.

Why - want to stay on track, want to become more productive
