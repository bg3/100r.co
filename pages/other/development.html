    <h1>Site Development</h1>
    <p class="intro">I'm currently putting the site together by hand as I work out the structure and style before I start working on a static generator.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each page should have a draft or notes section at the bottom. I'll start pages in draft and gradually build them up. The notes will become footnotes, or a log of development, or notes for future updates.</li>
      <li><a href="https://nomand.co">nomand.co</a> has 'Garage' and 'Graveyard' sections. I was calling mine formation>development>complete (>abandoned), but I want better names for formation and development.</li>
