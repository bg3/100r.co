<h1>Black-eyed bean curry</h1><p>My friend Ryan described this as a revelation, "it's as though I've never eaten beans before".</p>
<p>From <a href="https://natliciousfood.com/recipes/black-eyed-peas-in-creamy-coconut-sauce/">Natlicious food</a>.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup dried black-eyed beans</li>
	<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
	<li>vegetable oil</li>
	<li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
	<li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp turmeric paste</li>
	<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
	<li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
	<li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
	<li>400mL coconut cream</li>
	<li>vegetable stock cube</li>
	<li>bunch of chopped parsley</li>
	<li>lemon or lime to serve</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>You can soak the dried beans in cold water overnight, but it's quicker to put them in a saucepan with 2.5L of cold water, bring to a boil and then turn off and soak for 4 hours before rinsing.</p>
<p>Grating the ginger, garlic and turmeric is easiest with a Japanese ceramic grater, a microplane, box grater or even finely mincing them will also work.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry until sweating and softened.</p>
<p>Stir through the pastes, oregano, chilli and curry powder and cook for a minute or two. Add the beans, stir through to coat with the onion and spices then mix through the coconut cream.</p>
<p>Cook for 10-15 minutes then stir through the parsley and season to taste. Serve with citrus.</p>
