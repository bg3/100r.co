<pre>2019-12-14   First sailing in our yacht. Sandringham to Docklands. Arrived in the middle of a speech by Lisa Blair. Met Dan, won a trip on Lisa's yacht next week, went for dinner: us three, Lisa and Tom (Corsair, Southport).</pre>
<pre>2019-12-16   Visited yacht around 7pm to fit new mooring lines. Met Lisa and Mark who are in opposite berth.</pre>
<pre>2019-12-21   Dan, Sarah and I went sailing on Lisa's yacht. Winds were 25+ kts, she decided it was too rough to take us out into the bay. We sailed up and back the port entry a few times.</pre>
<h2>ENGINEERING AND MAINTENANCE</h2>

<pre>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
<pre>2020-01-12   OBS/TODO            Thought engine was not going into gear, opened up to investigate.</pre>
<pre>Turned out to be the switch on the throttle not pressed in properly.</pre>
<pre>Somehow broke ignition cylinder and couldn't turn engine off!</pre>
<pre>Tried to kink fuel line, but that didn't seem to work (maybe didn't wait long enough).</pre>
<pre>Had to pull out fuel line entirely - engine ran for another 15 mins!</pre>
<pre>Now need to prime the engine and replace the ignition cylinder!</pre>
<pre>2019-12-16   APPL.               Switched worn lines that came with boat for new mooring lines: 16mm by 10m.</pre>
<pre>NOTE                10m line is too short for spring lines.</pre>
<pre>Test: lifted rear port shackle using shock cord to reduce rattle.</pre>
<pre>Test: tied shock cord b/w mainsheet and toerail to stop sliding in wind.</pre>
<pre>IDEA/TODO           Cut wooden block to fit between traveller pieces and stop sliding.</pre>
<pre>Sprayed lubricant on squealing companionway hatch. Did not fix - interior.</pre>
<pre>IDEA/TODO           Remove companionway roof and lubricate interior.</pre>
<pre>Improve bilge drainage!</pre>
<pre>Replace prop anode.</pre>
