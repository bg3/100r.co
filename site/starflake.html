Italy has very little to lose and much to gain from attacking Austria. If he fails he can take Tunis and wait around for other offers which are almost certain to come his way. If he succeeds he is on his way to a good game. Consequently Italy should be encouraged to play a Lepanto opening, or perhaps even the Key Lepanto. (As Austria I don't like the Key Lepanto but it does have the merit that you know Italy will order to Tri so that you can take the appropriate defensive action!) If Italy doesn't bite at this bait, or if you suspect that he will still attack anyway, then Austria has to consider the moves of A(Rom)-Ven with A(Ven) to either Tri or Tyr. If Austria believes Russia will not be going to Gal then he has just one unit with which to defend against Italy and still take Ser and Gre. That unit is A(Vie). It then remains whether to order A(Vie)-Tyr or Tri and I believe the odds are in favour of the Austrian player.</p></main></body>
