The original has a light airy feel, but there are a few awkward characters and some that are hard to distinguish (WV). Some of its quirks (blocky X and period) are its best features though - it seems to me that the typeface was designed to leave a pixel border wherever possible... maybe for showing on inverted background.</p><p>You can download a copy as a <a href="https://parkimminent.com/media/bin/spectrum-pi.chr">.chr file</a> for <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nasu.html">Nasu</a>.</p></main></body>
