      &lt;p class=&apos;&apos;&gt;Before and during the {*Reef Wars*}, Variks was the {_House Judgement_} scribe to House Wolves. Skolas, their last Kell, was vicious, even for a Kell, and used hit-and-run tactics against civilians. Petra Venj believes this is what caused Variks to betray Skolas to the Queen. Variks contacted the Queen after the Fortuna Plummet and told her of Skolas’ plan to attack the military fortress of Cybele. This led directly to Skolas’ capture. At the end of the Reef Wars, Variks declared Mara Sov the new Kell of Wolves and advised the Fallen captured at Cybele to serve her. As reward for his loyalty, the Queen gave Variks the key to the Prison of Elders, which he ran as a battle arena for Guardians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&apos;&apos;&gt;After Uldren’s disappearance at the Battle of Saturn, Petra gave Variks oversight of the Crows, which he began to use in order to look for a new Kell of Kells. Variks also assisted the City in hunting down the remnants of the House of Wolves during the Taken War.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class=&apos;&apos;&gt;She was the first Ghost to arrive, but it wasn&apos;t long until there were dozens of them, scanning every pile of debris that remained of Tower North. They came in search of the one who guided their journeys, the one who once spoke for the Traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&apos;bullet&apos;&gt;&lt;li class=&apos;&apos;&gt;&quot;He called me Dejana. Before I met him, I didn&apos;t know what to call myself.&quot; She was speaking to a red-shelled one, who hovered where the Speaker once studied the Light. His eyes were ever fixed on the new brilliance of the Living Traveler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p class=&apos;&apos;&gt;For a long time when I was young, my dad searched for a book called {_John G. Alden and His Yacht Designs_}. It must have been somewhere around the end of the 80s. Our family hadn&apos;t heard of the internet, so searching meant asking at every book store and even visits to the State Library. He didn&apos;t find a copy until after I&apos;d left home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&apos;&apos;&gt;We learned things about boats and sailing from him. The Roaring Forties and how dangerous it was to round Cape Horn. You weren&apos;t a real sailor until you&apos;d done that, and you got an earring once you had. (what else). He is great with knots too.&lt;/p&gt;
