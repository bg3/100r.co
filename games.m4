<h2>Foul Airs</h2>
<p><em>A deadly sickness has fallen upon your kingdom. At the behest of your council, you remain isolated in your chambers.</em></p>
<p>I made this game in 10-12 hours over two days for the _link(.:Merveilles Hyperjam:.,.:https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries:.). My first game jam and I guess it's the only game I ever 'released'.</p>
