  NAME: And there's silver down below where the herring fishes go
  PARENT: testing
  BODY
    <p>It is now 31/2 years since Richard Sharp documented the Austrian Hedgehog openings in Dolchsto? issue 47. Richard introduced it by explaining that because Austria had the worst record for early elimination, his first duty was therefore to defend himself.</p>
    <p>This began an upsurge of Hedgehog openings and by the time that Richard's excellent book was published, his attitude had hardened so much that he dismissed other Austrian openings as "inadequate". Thus Hedgehog openings began to become the norm, rather than the exception.</p>
    <p>Originally, I too was convinced that the Hedgehog was the answer to Austria's problems, but over the last two years or so I have become more and more disillusioned and I now consider that except for certain circumstances, it is a bad opening. For the benefit of novices, the Hedgehog is F(Tri)-Ven, A(Vie)-Gal, and A(Bud)-Rum (or more usually A(Bud)-Ser - the Southern hedgehog). The argument for these apparently violent openings is that they keep Russia out of Gal, completely stop Italy in his tracks if he tries for Tri (or spilt his armies if he tries A(Ven)-Tyr, A(Rom)-Ven), and virtually guarantee Austria retention of all home centres and one build in 1901.</p>
    <p>My view is that if Austria is fairly sure that Italy and Russia will attack in Spring 1901 then the opening is warranted; however it will probably only prolong the agony unless Austria is able to split the alliance somehow. I believe that this is the only time the Hedgehog should be used - a desperate situation requiring drastic measures. Far better for Austria to try to convince them not to attack and make an opening that will result in Gre and Ser being taken in 1901 and this is not as difficult as some advocates of the Hedgehog make it out to be.</p>
    <p>First of all Russia must be kept out of Gal and I think the best way is to seek German help on this point. Germany should be asked if he will order F(Kie)-Den, and in addition if he will tell Russia that he will be doing so and will stand the Russians out of Swe in the Autumn if a unit is moved to Gal in the spring. Most Germany's will be sympathetic to this approach for various reasons, and the request is not as outlandish as it may first appear. Germany should recognise that a successful Russian attack on Austria is bad news as a strong Russia invariably causes Germany problems in the middle game and this is one way to help to keep him down to a respectable size in 1901/2. Furthermore, although I believe that the fleet opening to Den is usually Germany's best option, it is not always desirable for Germany to stand Russia out of Swe in 1901. In fact, given Russian F(Swe) (and perhaps A(StP) or F(StP)nc English A(Nwy) or F(Nwy) and German F(Den) after the 1901 builds, Germany is in an interesting diplomatic position and will have earned Russian thanks by allowing him into Swe. So the German "threat" to Russia is powerful and yet not really sufficient to anger Russia and will most likely have the effect of pushing Russia into a war with Turkey which is all to Russia's advantage. It is by no means a certainty but the Austrian player should get a pretty clear idea of whether Gal is likely to be invaded by Russia from his diplomacy with both Russia and Germany.</p>
    <p>The Italian problem is more difficult and much more dangerous. Italy has very little to lose and much to gain from attacking Austria. If he fails he can take Tunis and wait around for other offers which are almost certain to come his way. If he succeeds he is on his way to a good game. Consequently Italy should be encouraged to play a Lepanto opening, or perhaps even the Key Lepanto. (As Austria I don't like the Key Lepanto but it does have the merit that you know Italy will order to Tri so that you can take the appropriate defensive action!) If Italy doesn't bite at this bait, or if you suspect that he will still attack anyway, then Austria has to consider the moves of A(Rom)-Ven with A(Ven) to either Tri or Tyr. If Austria believes Russia will not be going to Gal then he has just one unit with which to defend against Italy and still take Ser and Gre. That unit is A(Vie). It then remains whether to order A(Vie)-Tyr or Tri and I believe the odds are in favour of the Austrian player.</p>
    <p>Opening statistics show more Italian moves to Tyr than Tri, and some of the moves to Tri are as a pre-arranged Key Lepanto. SO an order to Tyr does look the best bet. Even better if Austria can persuade Germany to order A(Mun)-Tyr in a peace-keeping role, but experience shows that Germany usually has different and more pressing uses for A(Mun). Scrutiny of letters from Russia, Italy and Turkey may give some help in the decision between Tri/Tyr but it should be remembered that if Italy goes into Tri then an Austrian home centre is certain to be lost in 1901. However, if A(Vie) goes to Tri while Italy plays to Tyr and Ven, Italy only has a 50/50 chance of taking an Austrian centre.</p>
    <p>If played successfully this Balkan Gambit (as Richard Sharp named it) either Tyrolian or Trieste variation, has the distinct advantage of keeping friendly with both Russia and Turkey until at least 1902 - plus the potential gain of two centres. Furthermore, if Italy does indeed play the Lepanto then Austria remains friendly with everyone. If things go wrong then I admit it can be difficult, but the skill comes in the diplomacy and the ability to recognise what is likely to happen.</p>
    <p>The fallacy of the Hedgehog - as I see it - lies in the fact that Austria makes too many enemies and causes himself to be surrounded. But more important, the lone fleet is bottled up in Tri and not only does this deny Austria further fleet builds, it also denies him the important strategic position of F(Gre). This supply centre I consider to be one of the key centres on the board, bordering the important sea lanes of ION and AEG. I submit that it is Austria's prime duty to get the fleet to Gre, and if necessary to take risks to do so!</p>

corn-congee
  NAME: Corn congee
  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>If you've had a bad experience with congee or the idea of savoury rice porridge doesn't sound appealing, I implore you to reconsider - it's such a satisfying dish. This recipe is from <i>Smith & Deli-cious</i> by Mo Wyse and Shannon Martinez.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil, plus extra to garnish</li>
      <li>4 large spring onions, white and green parts, finely sliced, plus extra to garnish</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>20 g ginger, peeled and julienned</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>420 g tin of creamed corn</li>
      <li>150 g jasmine rice</li>
      <li>3 tbsp Shaoxing wine or dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 litre vegetable or chicken stock</li>
      <li>freshly sliced chilli or chilli oil, to garnish</li>
      <li>pickled Chinese mushrooms, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Heat both oils in a saucepan over a medium heat. Sweat off the spring onion, garlic and ginger until soft, then add the star anise. Cook for another minute, then add the corn, stir again and cook for another 2 minutes.</p>
    <p>Add the rice and stir to coat. Add the wine and soy sauce and cook out for 30 seconds. Pour the stock over the rice and bring to a simmer. Reduce he heat to low and cook, stirring regularly to avoid the rice sticking for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the rice is very soft and beginning to fall apart. Add a little extra stock if needed during cooking. Remove the star anise.</p>
    <p>Garnish with extra sliced spring onion and a drizzle of sesame oil. If you like it hot, add some fresh chilli or chilli oil.</p>

soba
  NAME: Soba (buckwheat noodles)
  PARENT : recipes
  BODY
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The weights here are relative to the water - e.g. if you have 100g of water, then you need 160g of buckwheat flour and 40g of wheat flour.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>160 % buckwheat flour</li>
      <li>40 % wheat flour</li>
      <li>100 % water</li>
      <li>tapioca flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Mix flours and water in bowl with your fingers until a stiff crumbly dough is formed. Knead until smooth then turn out onto a surface that has been lightly dusted with tapioca flour. Shape into a cone then press down so you have a thick coin with a flat bottom.</p>
    <p>Use a rolling pin to roll into a flat sheet, longer in one direction than the other. Dust the top with more tapioca flour and then fold the sheet in half across its width. Dust the top with tapioca flour and fold again.</p>
    <p>Use a sharp knife to cut the folded sheet into folded noodles.</p>
    <p>Have a large bowl of iced water ready.</p>
    <p>To cook, drop the noodles into a pot of rapidly boiling water for 60 seconds. Might need a little longer if your noodles are thick.</p>
    <p>Lift them out (using a strainer or cooking chopsticks) and drop them into the iced water.</p>
    <p>Serve with kombu dashi (a broth), soy, sliced spring onions and shichimi togarashi (a pepper/spice mix)... or whatever you like.</p>

    <p>Pour the mixture into the tin. Bake for 30 mins or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove and transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool fully.</p>
    <p>For the icing, sieve the icing sugar into a bowl. Mix in just enough lemon juice to make an icing thick enough to pour over the loaf (if you make the icing too thin, it will just run off the cake).</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>I used 3/4 self raising cake flour, 1/4 self raising flour.</p>

  BODY
    <p>from _Bake & Destroy_ by Natalie Slater</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2.25 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>4.5 cups plain flour</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li>
      <li>12 veggie hot dogs</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture begins to foam.</p>
    <p>Add the flour and margarine and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined.</p>
    <p>Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil.</p>
    <p>Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C. Once the dough has risen, pinch off golf-ball-sized pieces and roll them into 12-inch ropes. You might want to flour your hands and the surface you're rolling on because this dough is sticky.</p>
    <p>Wrap each veggie dog in the dough and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.</p>
    <p>Mix warm water and baking soda together. Brush each wrapped dog with this mixture and then bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>
    <p>Brush each baked dog with melted margarine and sprinkle with kosher salt.</p>

black-pepper-tofu
  NAME: Black pepper tofu
  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>[[https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/black-pepper-tofu-a This recipe]] is from Yotam Ottolenghi's Plenty. It is <em>very</em> peppery.<p>
    <figure><img src="../media/img/codex/3.jpg" class="wide"></figure>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>800g firm tofu</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>cornflour to dust the tofu</li>
      <li>150g butter</li>
      <li>12 small shallots (350g in total), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>8 fresh red chillies (fairly mild ones), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>12 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>3 tbsp chopped fresh root ginger</li>
      <li>3 tbsp sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)</li>
      <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
      <li>5 tbsp coarsely crushed black peppercorns (use a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder)</li>
      <li>16 small and thin spring onions, cut into 3cm segments</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Start with the tofu. Pour enough oil into a large frying pan or wok to come 5mm up the sides and heat. Cut the tofu into large cubes, about 3 x 2cm. Toss them in some cornflour and shake off the excess, then add to the hot oil. (You’ll need to fry the tofu pieces in a few batches so they don’t stew in the pan.) Fry, turning them around as you go, until they are golden all over and have a thin crust. As they are cooked, transfer them onto kitchen paper.</p>
    <p>Remove the oil and any sediment from the pan, then put the butter inside and melt it. Add the shallots, chillies, garlic and ginger. Sauté on low to medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients have turned shiny and are totally soft. Next, add the soy sauces and sugar and stir, then add the crushed black pepper.</p>
    <p>Add the tofu to warm it up in the sauce for about a minute. Finally, stir in the spring onions. Serve hot, with steamed rice.</p>

    <figure><img src="../media/img/codex/chilli-oil.jpg" class="wide"></figure>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tbsp Sichuan chilli flakes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp five spice</li>
      <li>3 tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup peanut or other vegetable oil</li>
      <li>thin slice of fresh ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Place all ingredients in a heat proof bowl (not a thin ceramic or glass one). I place the bowl in the sink just in case of an accident. Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl. Heat the cup of oil with the ginger in it, until the ginger fries and turns golden brown - this is about 180-90 degrees.</p>
    <p>Carefully pour the oil into the bowl over the spices and stir with a metal spoon. Once cool, remove the bay leaves and star anise, then store in a clean class jar or bottle. It will keep a long time in the fridge, or a few weeks at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Roast potatoes</h2>
    <p>Marcus Wareing</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 large King Edward potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>fine salt</li>
      <li>100 mL vegetable oil</li>
      <li>sea salt, to serve</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <p>Put potatoes in saucepan, cover with cold water and add 1.5 tsp of fine salt. Cover and bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn down to medium. Simmer gently for 15 minutes until the potatoes are almost quick - the tip of a small, sharp knife should go in easily without breaking the potato up.</p>
     <p>Heat oven to 200 C (fan). Drain the potatoes and shake well, leaving them to dry out for a few minutes. Heat the oil in a roasting pan in the oven until very hot.</p>
     <p>Place potatoes one by one into the oil. Season with a pinch of fine salt and turn until coated, then return the pan to the oven.</p>
     <p>Roast the potatoes for 30-40 minutes, turning them every 10 minutes and sprinkling them with sea salt about halfway through when they're starting to colour.</p>
     <p>Remove and drain on kitchen paper.</p>

     <h2>Sweet pepper salad</h2>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>100 ml olive oil</li>
       <li>4 red capsicums</li>
       <li>4 yellow capsicums</li>
       <li>1 small bunch of fresh thyme</li>
       <li>2 red onions, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>a handful of fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>a handful of fresh marjoram leaves</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <p>Heat oven to 200 C (fan). Put 3 tbsp oil in a heavy roasting pan and place over high heat. When hot add capsicums, some of the thyme sprigs and salt and pepper. Fry for about 10 minutes until the capsicums are tinged brown on all sides. Put the pan in the oven and roast for 10 minutes then place peppers in a large bowl and cover to steam until cool.</p>
     <p>Peel and cut into 5mm wide strips, removing seeds. Reserve juices.</p>
     <p>Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan, saute the garlic, onions and remaining thyme for a few minutes. Season with salt then cook until the onions are lightly coloured and softening. Remove thyme. Add peppers and seasoning, cook for 2 mins more. Transfer to a bowl, add juices and cool a little.</p>
     <p>To serve, stir basil and marjoram through, drizzle with remaining oil and sprinkle with sea salt.</p>

     <h2>Couscous with candied lemon</h2>
     <p>Marcus Wareing</p>

       <li>250 mL stock</li>
       <li>75 g raisins</li>
       <li>50-75 g shelled pistachios, toasted and roughly chopped</li>
       <li>handful of roughly chopped coriander</li>
       <li>splash of vinaigrette dressing</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>For the candied lemon</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>150 g caster sugar</li>
       <li>1 small lemon, very thinly sliced and pips removed</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <ul>
       <p>Candy the lemon: mix sugar with 150 mL cold water in a heavy saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat. Add lemon slices. Reduce heat to barest simmer and cook for 40-60 mins until the slices are soft and syrupy.</p>
       <p>Put couscous in large bowl and whisk with the hot stock. Cover tightly and leave for at least 30 minutes, whisking several times. Put raisins in small bowl, cover with warm water and leave to soak.</p>
       <p>Remove lemon slices, when cool enough to handle chop into small pieces. Drain the raisins and chop roughly.</p>
       <p>Fluff up the couscous, add about 1/3 of the chopped lemon with the raisins and pistachios, mix well. Can warm at this stage in a bowl over simmering water. Stir through coriander and add more lemon + seasoning if desired.</p>
     </ul>

     <h2>Chilli beans</h2>
     <p>Marcus Wareing</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>

       <li>50g dried green adzuki beans, soaked in cold water for a few hours</li>
       <li>30g Puy lentils</li>
       <li>5 tbsp olive oil</li>
       <li>1 Spanish onion (yellow onion), finely chopped</li>
       <li>2 red capsicums, finely chopped</li>
       <li>2 hot red chillies, finely chopped</li>
       <li>2 tsp chilli powder</li>
       <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
       <li>300g ripe tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and chopped (or 400g can of chopped tomatoes)</li>
       <li>500mL tomato juice</li>
       <li>leaves of 1 bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <p>Blanch (bring to boil over high heat from cold, then drain under cold water immediately) the kidney beans, then return to pain with cold water and bring to a 10 minute rapid boil to make them easier to digest. Half cover the pan, turn down heat and simmer for 30-45 minutes.</p>
     <p>Blanc adzuki beans and lentils separately, then bring both to the boil separately. Half cover and simmer until tender: 12-15 mins for the beans and 20-25 mins for the lentils. Drain and set aside.</p>
     <p>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add onion, capsicum, chillies and garlic. Sprinkle in chilli powder and salt, cook for 5 mins to soften vegetables. Add tomatoes, beans, lentils and juice and stir to mix. Cover and simmer for 45-60 mins stirring occasionally.</p>
     <p>Stir coriander into beans and season.</p>

  PARENT: programming
  BODY:
    <p>After making some very simple 4 and 8-bit processors in Logisim, I was getting frustrated at the difficulty of exploring processor designs - making changes required a lot of tedious rerouting and reconnecting and I wouldn't be sure an idea would even work. @neauoire had much better results starting with a VM, and so I decided to give it a try.</p>
    <p>The design goal is to come up with a fairly simple, idiosyncratic machine that encourages low res 3D graphics. While a general purpose computer can obviously render 3D graphics, I wouldn't say it's encouraged by the design in the same way the NES encourages sprites and tilemaps. I'd also like to design the system so it's features and limitations lead to a distinctive and recognisable style.</p>
