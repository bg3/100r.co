corn-congee
  NAME: Corn congee
  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>If you've had a bad experience with congee or the idea of savoury rice porridge doesn't sound appealing, I implore you to reconsider - it's such a satisfying dish. This recipe is from <i>Smith & Deli-cious</i> by Mo Wyse and Shannon Martinez.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil, plus extra to garnish</li>
      <li>4 large spring onions, white and green parts, finely sliced, plus extra to garnish</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>20 g ginger, peeled and julienned</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>420 g tin of creamed corn</li>
      <li>150 g jasmine rice</li>
      <li>3 tbsp Shaoxing wine or dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 litre vegetable or chicken stock</li>
      <li>freshly sliced chilli or chilli oil, to garnish</li>
      <li>pickled Chinese mushrooms, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Heat both oils in a saucepan over a medium heat. Sweat off the spring onion, garlic and ginger until soft, then add the star anise. Cook for another minute, then add the corn, stir again and cook for another 2 minutes.</p>
    <p>Add the rice and stir to coat. Add the wine and soy sauce and cook out for 30 seconds. Pour the stock over the rice and bring to a simmer. Reduce he heat to low and cook, stirring regularly to avoid the rice sticking for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the rice is very soft and beginning to fall apart. Add a little extra stock if needed during cooking. Remove the star anise.</p>
    <p>Garnish with extra sliced spring onion and a drizzle of sesame oil. If you like it hot, add some fresh chilli or chilli oil.</p>

soba
  NAME: Soba (buckwheat noodles)
  PARENT : recipes
  BODY
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The weights here are relative to the water - e.g. if you have 100g of water, then you need 160g of buckwheat flour and 40g of wheat flour.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>160 % buckwheat flour</li>
      <li>40 % wheat flour</li>
      <li>100 % water</li>
      <li>tapioca flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Mix flours and water in bowl with your fingers until a stiff crumbly dough is formed. Knead until smooth then turn out onto a surface that has been lightly dusted with tapioca flour. Shape into a cone then press down so you have a thick coin with a flat bottom.</p>
    <p>Use a rolling pin to roll into a flat sheet, longer in one direction than the other. Dust the top with more tapioca flour and then fold the sheet in half across its width. Dust the top with tapioca flour and fold again.</p>
    <p>Use a sharp knife to cut the folded sheet into folded noodles.</p>
    <p>Have a large bowl of iced water ready.</p>
    <p>To cook, drop the noodles into a pot of rapidly boiling water for 60 seconds. Might need a little longer if your noodles are thick.</p>
    <p>Lift them out (using a strainer or cooking chopsticks) and drop them into the iced water.</p>
    <p>Serve with kombu dashi (a broth), soy, sliced spring onions and shichimi togarashi (a pepper/spice mix)... or whatever you like.</p>

      <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>

    <p>Squeeze the garlic flesh from its skin and process in a blender with the tomatoes and any juice from the baking trays in two batches until smooth. Cook the tomato mixture, stock and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

lemon-cake
  NAME: Lemon cake
  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>from BBC Good Food
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100 ml vegetable oil
      <li>275 g self raising flour
      <li>200 g golden caster sugar
      <li>1 tsp baking powder
      <li>1/2 lemon, juiced
      <li>1/2 lemon, zested
    </ul>
    <h3>Icing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>150 g icing sugar
      <li>1/2 lemon, juiced
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Heat oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Oil a 1lb loaf tin and line it with baking parchment. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and lemon zest in a bowl. Add the oil, lemon juice and 170ml cold water, then mix until smooth.</p>
    <p>Pour the mixture into the tin. Bake for 30 mins or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove and transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool fully.</p>
    <p>For the icing, sieve the icing sugar into a bowl. Mix in just enough lemon juice to make an icing thick enough to pour over the loaf (if you make the icing too thin, it will just run off the cake).</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>I used 3/4 self raising cake flour, 1/4 self raising flour.</p>

pretzel-dogs
  NAME: Pretzel dogs
  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>from _Bake & Destroy_ by Natalie Slater</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2.25 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>4.5 cups plain flour</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li>
      <li>12 veggie hot dogs</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture begins to foam.</p>
    <p>Add the flour and margarine and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined.</p>
    <p>Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil.</p>
    <p>Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C. Once the dough has risen, pinch off golf-ball-sized pieces and roll them into 12-inch ropes. You might want to flour your hands and the surface you're rolling on because this dough is sticky.</p>
    <p>Wrap each veggie dog in the dough and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.</p>
    <p>Mix warm water and baking soda together. Brush each wrapped dog with this mixture and then bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>
    <p>Brush each baked dog with melted margarine and sprinkle with kosher salt.</p>

  PARENT: recipes
  BODY
    <p>[[https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/black-pepper-tofu-a This recipe]] is from Yotam Ottolenghi's Plenty. It is <em>very</em> peppery.<p>
    <figure><img src="../media/img/codex/3.jpg" class="wide"></figure>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>800g firm tofu</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>cornflour to dust the tofu</li>
      <li>150g butter</li>
      <li>12 small shallots (350g in total), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>8 fresh red chillies (fairly mild ones), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>12 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>3 tbsp chopped fresh root ginger</li>
      <li>3 tbsp sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)</li>
      <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
      <li>5 tbsp coarsely crushed black peppercorns (use a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder)</li>
      <li>16 small and thin spring onions, cut into 3cm segments</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Start with the tofu. Pour enough oil into a large frying pan or wok to come 5mm up the sides and heat. Cut the tofu into large cubes, about 3 x 2cm. Toss them in some cornflour and shake off the excess, then add to the hot oil. (You’ll need to fry the tofu pieces in a few batches so they don’t stew in the pan.) Fry, turning them around as you go, until they are golden all over and have a thin crust. As they are cooked, transfer them onto kitchen paper.</p>
    <p>Remove the oil and any sediment from the pan, then put the butter inside and melt it. Add the shallots, chillies, garlic and ginger. Sauté on low to medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients have turned shiny and are totally soft. Next, add the soy sauces and sugar and stir, then add the crushed black pepper.</p>
    <p>Add the tofu to warm it up in the sauce for about a minute. Finally, stir in the spring onions. Serve hot, with steamed rice.</p>

    <p>This character set is based on the ZX Spectrum system font, but extended to cover the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 ASCII OEM]] character set. The original Spectrum font has a light airy feel, but there are a few awkward characters and some that are hard to distinguish (e.g. W and V). Some of its quirks (blocky X and period) are what give the typeface its character, so I've left those unchanged.</p>
