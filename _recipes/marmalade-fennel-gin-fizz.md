## Ingredients

|---: | :---  | :--- |
| 1   |       | small fennel, chopped, fronds reserved |
| 1   | tsp   | fennel seeds |
| 1   | cup   | caster sugar (220g) |
| 1/2 | cup   | orange marmalade (170g) |
| 1/2 | cup   | orange-flavoured liqueur or orange juice (125ml) |
| 3/4 | cup   | gin or mineral water (185ml) |
|     |       | ice cubes, to serve |
| 1/2 | cup   | soda water, chilled (125ml) |
|     |       | orange marmalade, extra, to serve |

## Method
Place chopped fennel, fennel seeds, sugar and 1 cup (250ml) water in in saucepan over medium heat. Bring to simmer. Cook for 10 mins or until the sugar dissolves and syrup thickens slightly. Cool slightly. Strain through a fine sieve into a jug. Discard the solids. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to chill.

Place half the syrup, half the marmalade, half the liqueur or orange juice and half the gin or mineral water in a cocktail shaker with a few ice cubes. Shake until well combined. Strain among serving glasses.

Repeat with the remaining syrup, marmalade, liqueur or orange juice, gin or mineral water and ice. Add an ice cube to each glass. Top with soda water, extra marmalade and reserved fennel fronds.
